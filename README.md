I'm excited to share this project I worked on with Route Academy.

The main goal of this project is to create a user-friendly experience for managing and viewing products. The user interface is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to easily add, update, and delete products. Additionally, it includes a search feature for quick access to specific products, as it relies mainly on local storage.

The project implements data validation measures to ensure the accuracy of the information entered. This helps maintain data integrity and enhances the overall quality of user interaction.

In summary, this project is a responsive website with advanced product management, advanced search, and data validation features. It enhances business operations and delivers an advanced and user-friendly experience.
